## Summary 

As the end of the semester approaches, I'd like to reflect on the effects that this class had on me as a CS student. In terms of the skills I learned, I refined my skills with python and IDEs like pycharm. I was also exposed to a lot of NLP techniques and a lot of data science techniques. These data science techniques im especially grateful for, as they are very useful for routine tasks such as preprocessing data. NLP is a new and exciting field that I am keen to keep up with and observe, especially with developments like ChatGPT. In terms of future personal projects, I don't have any concrete plans, as I am more interested in other fields, But I am definitely interested in keeping up with the field. In terms of employment opportunities, I am more interested in other fields and already have a foot in the door in one of them, so I will probably focus on that.
