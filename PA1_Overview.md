## What the program does

The program reads in data on people from a csv file. It then processes it, makes sure that all the data in the fields is entered in correctly, creates an object for each person's data, and then adds each object to a dictionary. Then, it creates a pickle file of the dictionary, then unpickles it, and displays each person's data.

## How to run

Type `py {file name} {data path}` into the command line for the program to run. Assuming the file name is `Homework1_axi180011` and the data path is `data/data.csv`, enter `py Homework1_axi180011.py data/data.csv` in the command line.

## Strengths and weaknesses of Python for text processing

Some of the strengths of python for text processing are that it has large libraries that are very useful for things such as regex. It also has easy to use built-in features such as splitting and slicing. Perhaps the biggest weakness of python is that it is not very performant; as it is an interpreted language, it is slow compared to other compiled languages.

## What I learned in this assignment

Some of the things that I learned in this assignment was how to use csv, regex, and pickling in Python. I have used csv and regex in other languages, but using their modules in Python was new for me. Some of the things that were a review for me are the concepts of sysargs, file I/O, and classes.
